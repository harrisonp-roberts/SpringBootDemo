This is a demo of the Spring Boot framework. It is a RESTful web service that has the ability to connect to a MySQL
database. It is pretty much exactly like the FDR_UI project, except it doesn't contain a front end, and is much smaller.
Other than angular, it contains pretty much all components of the full project (to my knowledge). The pom.xml is used by
maven. It is ONLY used to import dependencies automatically instead of adding libraries by hand over and over again. Don't
worry about it.
